# Proyecto-ECA
This project develops portable devices with temperature, heart rate, and GPS sensors to monitor livestock well-being and location in real-time. Data is sent via LoRa to a central node, processed, and uploaded to the cloud. It offers a cost-effective solution to enhance livestock security and comply with animal welfare standards.
